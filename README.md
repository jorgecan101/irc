This is going to be a project to understand networking (sockets) in Java, where i will make a irc chat client.

TODO:
- Fix bugs/issues that most likely exist (besides mentioned ones)
- Fix SocketClosed errors
- Fix issue where user name appears blank when someone else is typing (might be fixed (windows terminal at least))
- Make sure two users cannot have the same name
- Create a login system with passwords for users
- Implement a GUI (far goal)
